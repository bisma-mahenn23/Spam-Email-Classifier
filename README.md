# Spam-Email-Classifier

A basic machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam.

# Overview
- Preprocessed raw email text data
- Vectorize text using CountVectorizer
- Trained classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC etc.)
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

# Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (Ensemble)
- Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning

# Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
